This script will load a stock's K_Chart csv from Goodinfo website,
and write the info into mongodb.
Please note that I change the first row to make it loaded by pandas easier.
You can just copy the frist row in my K_Chart csv and paste to the one you downloaded.
Or you can write another script to do this.
